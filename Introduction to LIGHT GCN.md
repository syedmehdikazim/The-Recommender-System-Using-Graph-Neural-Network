It is the work inspired from the paper of LIGHT-GCN (graph convolutional network). the brief summary of the paper is following:-

LIGHT-GCN intoducntion

Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are a class of neural network models specifically designed for learning representations of graph-structured data. The LIGHT GCN paper likely proposes a novel variant or improvement to the GCN architecture.
GCNs operate by propagating information through the graph using graph convolutional layers. Each layer performs a transformation that combines features from a node's neighboring nodes to update its representation. This allows the model to capture relational information and dependencies within the graph.
The LIGHT GCN approach may introduce modifications to improve the efficiency, scalability, or accuracy of GCNs. It could potentially address challenges such as high memory consumption or computational complexity that are commonly associated with existing GCN architectures.
The paper may present experimental results on benchmark datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed LIGHT GCN method. It could compare its performance against other state-of-the-art GCN models, showcasing improvements in terms of accuracy, training speed, or memory efficiency.

We have improved the model accuracy by performing multiclass classification on Movie lens data and compared our results to the original paper which shows slight improvement even though we they used amazon book data which is quiet synonamous to movie lens
